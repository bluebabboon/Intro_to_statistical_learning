# We can use the tree library to construct the classification and regression tree
library(tree)

# We first use the classification trees to analyze the Carseats data set. In this data Sales is
#   a continous variable , and we begin by recording it as a binary variable.
# We can use the ifelse() fucntion to create a variable called High which takes Yes if the
#   Sales variable exceed a threshold and here it is 8, and takes No if otherwise

library(ISLR)

attach(Carseats)

# We have created the carseats data and now we create High variable
High = ifelse(Sales > 8 , "Yes","No")

# Creating a new dataframe attaching the Carseats and the newly created variable High to it
cardata = data.frame(Carseats,High)

# We can now use the tree funciton to fit a classification tree in order to predict High using
#   all the variabels but Sales. THe syntax of the tree() function is quite similar to the lm()
#   function

tree_fit_carseats = tree(High~.-Sales, cardata)

# In the above fit we are using all the predictors by giving a . after the ~ and then excluding
#   the variable Sales ,since if we incldue it all the trees will be just showing the Sales data
#   because we derived High data from it.
